# Bypass Printing Limits/Fast Printing

The printer in VOTV has Strict limits to what can be printed with the printer. If you're model is bigger is bigger than the limits then the printer will refuse to print it at all, but as well the bigger the object the longer it will take the printer to print said object. Shrimply taking 20 minutes to even an hour to print even some of the more bigger complex models here.

This how every is easily bypassble, and will save you alot of time if you're printing larger complex models. You will need to this model to help you with this trick.

### [The Stick](https://github.com/madrod228/voicesoftheprinter/raw/main/The%20Archive/Bypass-Speedprint/Stick.rar)

This is shrimply an untextured Stick. It only takes a little bit to print, and it's large enough for you to see and grab it. We'll be using this to show you how to bypass the limits and speed of the printer.

First off You will want to rename the stick the model you want to print. I'll be using Big Kel for this.

Now the model of Big Kel is named as so.

So we will rename the model of the Stick to kelbigtest as well. You can also go ahead and put the textures of the model in the printer folder as well.

Now print the model.

Once the model it printed you need to grab the model with E. While you are grabbing the model press R to hold it.

Now pause the game and alt tab out. Drag the the real model you want to print the same name as the one you gave the stick into the printer folder, and hit Replace file when the prompt comes up.

Now go back into VOTV. The model of will be unchanged until you drop it. If you want to put the model inside the base and its bigger than the door I recommend to keep holding it until you get to the spot you want to put it. Otherwise, press Alt + R to drop the model and it will change into the real model.

And Ta Dah the model instantly changes to the real deal. Now you're probably wondering. "Is there a limit for how big we can make a model be?" I do not know. Maybe until the game crashes? Who knows someone else has certainly tried.
